# Density Gridder

Takes 3D particle data and maps on to a density grid, using MPI. Can optionally apply convolution using serial R scripts.


# Compile

To compile gridder.c execute the following in the top level directory.

```
make clean
make
```

# To run 

To run the gridder on the login node you need to load the following modules. Only do this if the grid you wish to make is relatively inexpensive. Otherwise, submit a job as usual.

```
module unload intel_comp
module load gnu_comp
module load openmpi
module load hdf5

mpirun -np 4 gridder.x
```


## *Deprecated*

```
mpicc -I/usr/include/hdf5/serial -o parallel_hdf5 -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial parallel_hdf5.c -lhdf5 -lm -lgmp
```
